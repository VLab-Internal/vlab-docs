# Introduction to VLab
## What is it?
VLab is a multi-platform custom engine made from scratch. You can develop for it using multiple programs, such as the Scene Generator (scenegen) and the CLI Editor (editorcli)
## Why would Vortex Studios use it over other engines?
VLab is performant and strips away any unnecessary components, systems and resources. It is efficient in both space and performance, while still being highly customizable.
