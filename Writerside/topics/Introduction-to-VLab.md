# Introduction to VLab
## Q/A
### What is it?
VLab is a multi-platform custom engine made from scratch. You can develop for it using multiple programs, such as the Scene Generator (scenegen) and the CLI Editor (editorcli)
### Why would Vortex Studios use it over other engines?
VLab is performant and strips away any unnecessary components, systems and resources. It is efficient in both space and performance, while still being highly customizable.
### Would it be easy to use?
No.
### Would it be public?
We currently don't have plans on making the source code public.
### What games use it?
Some of our in-pipeline projects use the alpha revision of VLab. Once we finish development, we plan on making the B-Stage revision of VLab.
